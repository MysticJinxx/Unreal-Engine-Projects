## Blueprint Communication
Using an Unreal tutorial to learn how communicate between blueprints. In this project, I opened numerous doors in various ways. One of them used casting between the door and a lever to get the door to open when the lever was pulled. Another one had the player pass over a button to get the door to open, used blueprints to only open the door if it was the player that stepped on the button. Mostly just learning how to cast and get blueprints to communicate with eacother.

## C++ Challenges
About 40 different challenges in C++. I was tasked with creating multiple classes, some inherited. Using switches, try/catch, if/else, assignment opperators, math operators, etc. Theres a lot I learned from these challenges given by The Tech Academy.

## C++ Calculator Console Application
Used C++ to create a simple console calculator app. It is able to add, divide, subtract, and multiply 2 given numbers.

## C++ Class Challenge
Challenge which was used to get a deeper understand of classes and inheritance. Inherited a function called GetArea() to get the area of 3 different shapes.

## First Unreal Engine Game
Was given a couple hours to design a simple game in Unreal Engine 5. My game is called Human Frogger, and the goal is to jump accross the moving platforms to get to the other side, but watch out, If you fall in, you die! Also has a main menu that can transistion to the game. When you reach the goal, it sends you to a victory screen.

## Templates and Basics
Simple project that was used to learn about the templates in Unreal, as well as how to add a win condition.

## Unreal Learning Kit
Went through the Unreal Learning Kit, and learned so much. I learned how to create different spawn points for the player. I learned how to animate moving platforms for the character to traverse. I learned how to create a collectable that the player can pick up and even update it to the Hud. I learned how to use a collectable key to unlock a door, and so much more. This was a great learning tool that Epic has put out!
